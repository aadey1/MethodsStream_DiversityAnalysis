# MethodsStream_DiversityAnalysis
This code and lesson goes along with the Methods in Stream Ecology Textbook. Please refer to the chapter on benthic invertebrates for further details.

The dataset used here is also used in the IBI assessments: 

To complete this lesson, you will use the code file "DiversityAnalyses.Rmd"
  This will walk you through how to calculate alpha, beta, and gamma diversity across sampling locations

The instruction guide "Instructions-DiversityAnalysis" will get you started on the analylsis and outline what each step of the code is doing.

If you have questions beyond the instruction guide, the "QuickReferenceGuide" provides more details.

Finally, the "DiversityAnalysisResultsInterpreation" outlines how to interpret and report your results from these analyses. The results will be contained in the files "alpha_diversity_results.csv", "jaccard_by_year.csv", "braycurtis_by_year.csv", and "diversity_summary_by_year.csv"
